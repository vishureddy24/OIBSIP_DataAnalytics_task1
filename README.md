# OIBSIP_DataAnalytics_task1

## Objective
To develop a linear Regression model that predicts the price of a house based on its features such as area,number of rooms, location , etc ....

## key steps 
-- imported housing dataset 
-- handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
-- visualized correlations between features and price 
-- trianed a Linear Regressipn model 
-- evaluated preformance using RMSE and R^2 score 

## tools and Libraries

-- pandas , numpy 
-- seaborn , Matplotlib
-- Scikit-Learn 

## outcome
A regression model capable of predicting house prices with good accuracy and visualization of important features relationships.
